# Exponential-Energy-on-Stock-Market
This code calculate the exponential energy of one market in order to get one volatility index.
In the study I used the formula to calculate the exponential energy in the market to see how it results.
Apparently, this code works perfectly to calculate the volatility of the prices in any stock.
You can change

Formula:
Potential Energy = mass * gravity * height

Where:
Mass = Any Number.
Gravity = Any number.
Height = EMA of Lowest Price - EMA of Largest Price.
