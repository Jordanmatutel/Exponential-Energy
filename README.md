# Exponential-and-Kinetic-Energy-on-Stock-Market
This code calculate the exponential and kinetic energy of one market in order to get one volatility index.
In the study I used the formula to calculate the kinetic and exponential energy in the market to see how it results.
This code includes how to use the indicator on one-dimensionals indexes.
